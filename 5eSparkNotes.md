The chapters and headers listed here match those in the Player's Handbook (PHB). Please refer to the PHB for further info/clarification.

# Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores
There are six attributes (important *general* usage in brackets per my opinion; each class has different requirements):
 - Strength (most melee weapons (including all 2-handed melee weapons), carry capacity, climbing/swimming/jumping/other Athletics -- the badass stat)
 - Dexterity (some melee weapons, ranged weapons, initiative, spell dodge, armour, Stealth -- the OP stat)
 - Constitution (health, poison/disease resist -- always important, governs max HP)
 - Intelligence (n/a)
 - Wisdom (Perception, social Insight -- important for spotting threats or points of interest)
 - Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion -- important for social interaction)

## Ability Scores and Modifiers
A score of 10-11 is "average human," 20 is the maximum for player characters. Modifier is used much more than score.

Score | Modifier
--- | ---
1 | -5
2-3 | -4
4-5 | -3
6-7 | -2
8-9 | -1
10-11 | +0
12-13 | +1
14-15 | +2
16-17 | +3
18-19 | +4
20-21 | +5

## Advantage and Disadvantage
Only affects d20 rolls. 
Advantage is "roll 2d20 use highest," disadvantage is "roll 2d20 use lowest." 
Neither effect stacks. You are either "at advantage/at disadvantage," or not.
Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out.

## Proficiency Bonus
Only affects d20 rolls.
Does not stack. You are either "proficient," or not.

## Ability Checks
When attempting to do anything that has a chance to fail.
Roll a d20 and add relevant bonuses.
Players generally trigger these by saying things like "I try to hide" or "Can I examine X for traces of magic?".
### Contests
Tug-of-war scenarios. Highest roll (with bonuses) wins. Ties generally result in neither side winning.
### Skills
See "Using Each Ability" in the PHB for a breakdown.
### Passive Checks
How good your character is when you're AFK. 
Passive scores are 10 + all relevant modifiers.
Mainly used for passive Perception, for spotting stealthy enemies or hidden traps.
### Working Together
One character proficient in a check can help another, giving them Advantage on their check.
#### Group Checks
Can be called for by the DM. If at least half the group succeeds, the group succeeds.

## Saving Throws
Roll a d20 and add relevant bonuses. Used to avoid negative effects.

# Chapter 8: Adventuring
## Resting
### Short Rest
1 hour rest (DM dependent). On completion, spend Hit Dice to heal. Some things recharge on short rest.
### Long Rest
8 hour rest (DM dependent). 6 hours minimum sleeping, 2 hours maximum light activity. Can't benefit from more than one in a 24-hour period. If interrupted by more than an hour of strenuous activity, must be restarted.

# Chapter 9: Combat
Turn-based, cycles through combatants in initiative order -- a round is one turn from each participant. A turn is action + bonus action + movement (all optional).

See [this quick reference](https://murray55669.github.io/dnd5e-quickref/quickref.html) for the short and sweet version, or to refer to when playing.
Alternatively, see PHB p189-198, this stuff is all pretty important.
